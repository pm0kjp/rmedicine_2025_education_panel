I’m a data science educator in biomedicine and I brought together other educators who work in different areas of the same field, to talk about a topic I think a lot of us care about, which is how to support people who are trying to learn R at work, while they’re busy doing lots of other things. And we’re trying to do this now in what I’ve euphemistically called “Interesting Times”.\nI’m going to ask the panelists to introduce themselves and what their primary educational audience is, and I’ll do that in alphabetical order by last name, and then I’ll start asking a couple of questions. Then I’d love to open it up to you, our participants, to engage with us, and make this a dialog.\nLet’s get started with our first panelist!"
